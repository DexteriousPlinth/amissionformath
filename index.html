			<h1 id="header">What is Tutor Time?</h1>
			<p>Tutor Time is a non-profit organization that focuses on one of the world's worst problems - education in mathematics. 
               Children today do not understand math very well. Even 50% of adults in England have the same amount of mathematical expertise as 11 year old school children. 
               The result of the teaching in public schools has taken a dark turn. If you want proof, just ask the 50% who have the same skill level as 11 year olds. It's because of one basic principle: memorization. Memorization is different than learning. Learning is understanding fully of what the concept is and how to apply in a situation in the real world, like using linear equations for speed, or statistics for projecting sales. This allows you to remember what the concept is and how to do it. Memorization is repetitively engraining into your mind, strict, rigid procedures. When memorizing these proccedures, no one really remembers them. There's a reason why almost no adult remembers calculus. It's because they never really learned. When you learn something, you can wield it creatively and flexibly without restraints. And going by these principles of learning and memorization, Tutor Time aims to allow every student to wield their intelligence creatively and flexibly without restraints to truly unlock the potential of the next generation.</p>
            <h1 id="header">What we aim to do</h1>
                <p>The real reason why students all over the world are tortured by the prospect of mathematics is because it is such an abstract concept.
            Students need to start seeing it as a language, as a way to express the many complexities and mysteries of the world. Instead of seeing a
            linear equation as a set of numbers, they should see it as a definition for the increase or decrease in rate for a specific situation, such as 
            speed of a vehicle, or the rate of water being pumped into a pool. By giving students relateable word problems, not only will students learn how to perform
            that specific concept, they will also be able to solve real world problems with ease because they already have experience with them.</p>
