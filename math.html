			<p>Algebra 1 is a eye-opening course. It takes you through the basic fundamentals of harder and more complicated math that will allow you to do much more amazing things with your mind other than add numbers and find the value of x. This course will allow to predict the starting and ending position of a ball in relative of height, it will teach you how to add, subtract, divide, and multiply big, huge numbers called polynomials. By the end of this you will be a genius-in-training! So why delay?</p>
